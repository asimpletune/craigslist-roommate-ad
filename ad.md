# Officer's house in the Presidio with "pretty" cool people
Hey you, glad you found this ad. My name is Larthur and I live at the house.

It's that time of year where beaver tails are thumping, birds be chirping, and people come and go. Sadly, our friends are moving to greener pastures, but what luck you have! This is a really lovely place, and we're all really happy, so we hope you like it as much as we do.

![2nd-floor-bathroomm](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NS9rOjoiTTtSZVKch4OaizlntoZwgIqAglAq8UCU4Rg=w1280-h960-no)

There are 4 bathrooms in the house. This is one of them. No, you don't have to share this. I just wanted to show it to you. The others are equally nice.

### Common areas of note
The house has a lot of space and really beautiful commons. You have to see it to fully appreciate it but here's a preview.

#### Kitchen

### Rooms available

All of rooms in the house are equally nice, seriously. The only real difference is price, for which you get space in exchange. Here's some extra info for your perusal. There are no pictures, but as you can imagine there are walls, windows and hardwood floor. They look like the rest of the house except smaller...

#### The Viceroy's Chamber

In this room, the viceroy can ponder the world, as you stroke your beard/pony tail. The is the largest room available and you will find much wisdom to be found, as you gaze out your bay facing window from within this stately corner room. Or if you tire of the sea, you can train your eyes on our sideyard, which is next to a highway (no, we don't mind. It's not that bad and it keeps the beasts at bay).

There's plenty of closet space as well for your fine silks and ray bans.

#### The Squire's Boudoir

Many squire's songs have been written for heroes of old in this inspirational space. Due to its excellent location, the squire's boudoir arguable receives the most light in the house. It also has an excellent closet, capable of holding all of your master's armor with room left still for a large trunk of ointments and other embrocations.

#### The Intern's Quarters

Ah yes, in the fast-paced, ever-changing landscape of this modern error, what better place to get a start of this brave new world than in the intern's quarters?
