# Officer's house in the Presidio with "pretty" cool people
Hey you, glad you found this ad. My name is Larthur and I live at the house.

It's that time of year where beaver tails are thumping, birds be chirping, and people come and go. O great Fortuna! Our palatial abode is expanding! What luck you have! This is a really lovely place, and we're all really happy, so we hope you like it as much as we do.

**tl;dr**
This house is beyond amazing, and we're "ok".
We have coming available July 1st or sooner:
* One XL sized room (about 15' x 20')
* One L sized room (about 15' x 15')
* Two M sized rooms (about 13' 13')
* An optional S sized room (about 15' x 8')

There is much, more more... you really have to see this place to believe it.

We are:
* AOK

You are:
* Yourself (hopefully)

Open house:
* TBD for this weekend (either 06/16, 06/17 or both - bring your dad if we end up coming on Sunday <3)

What to do next?
Also, this place will go very quickly so please keep that in mind. Express your interest by sending an email! Doesn't have to be crazy, you can read the "enhanced version of the ad" (down below), to learn what we're like. In terms of what we're looking for, just you! Be yourself!

## The place:
The Presidio is a former military base/mission turned national park. Located at the at the foot of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, the Presidio is one of the few places you can live in the city, where it doesn't feel like you're living in the city. Imagine beverly hills country club meets redwood tree forests, all bordered by rocky cliffs crumbling into sandy beaches by the ocean.

### Blueprint
The house has 3 floors, a basement, and a garage:

### Second floor Bathroom

There are 4 bathrooms in the house. This is one of them. No, you don't have to use this. I just wanted to show it to you. The others are equally nice. We all share, and there has never been a shortage of bathrooms.

### Common areas of note
The house has a lot of space and really beautiful commons. You have to see it to fully appreciate it but here's a preview.

#### Kitchen

The kitchen's pretty cool. We have a lot of counter and cabinet space. We have TWO fridges!!! (Can you believe it?) If you're into coffee, we have a pretty nice machine. Also, we use reusable lint-free towels instead of paper towels which is cool and it makes cleaning really easy.

Some of us cook every day, some of us not at all.

#### Living room

This room is the "mid-centch" room. You better be a mid-centchual...

But seriously, there's a lot of beauty in the commons space and people are always lounging about.

#### Dining room

It's like the living room but without as nice furniture. It also has table with chairs...

#### Back Porch

This is a major chill zone. We have two of these mid-centch sofas and we chill hard here. The weather's almost always nice so this is a great place to chill.

#### Cinema

We have an amazing movie theater. You wouldn't believe it...

#### Ping-pong

We play everyday and everyone's pretty good.

### Rooms available:

All of rooms in the house are equally nice, seriously. The only real difference is price, for which you get space in exchange. Here's some extra info for your perusal. There are no pictures, but as you can imagine there are walls, windows and hardwood floor, with the exception of one room that has carpet. They look like the rest of the house except smaller...

#### The Intern's Quarters (S sized)

Ah yes, in the fast-paced, ever-changing landscape of this modern error, what better place to get a start of this brave new world than in the intern's quarters? Spartan this room may be, with dimensions at around 8'x 15', nonetheless it is but a key to the kingdom of heaven that awaits in one's mind.

#### The Squire's Boudoir (M sized)

Many squires' songs have been written for heroes of old in this inspirational space. Due to its excellent location, the squire's boudoir arguable receives the most light in the house. It also has an excellent closet, capable of holding all of your master's armor with room left still for a large trunk of ointments and other embrocations.

#### The Despot's Spire (M sized)

Way up amongst the highest tower of our castle, lies the DESPOT'S SPIRE!!! Here, situated on the 3rd floor of the house, you may contrive your ploys and plots, as you so love to do! Rest assured that you will have ample head space to weigh the pros and cons of your political calculus, as the Despot's Spire is more secluded than the other rooms.

#### The Viceroy's Chamber (L sized)

In this room, the viceroy can ponder the world, as you stroke your beard/pony tail. The is a large room available and you will find much wisdom to be found, as you gaze out your bay facing window from within this stately corner room. Or if you tire of the sea, you can train your eyes on our sideyard, which is next to a highway (no, we don't mind. It's not that bad and it keeps the beasts at bay).

#### The Sultan's Suite (XL sized)

In this room, masters of their domain may bask in the glow of peace and comfort of the large open space and numerous windows. This allows for effortless concentration for someone who needs to ponder the sublime and infinite. This furnished room has an office, dedicated seating/living area for entertaining your subjects, and a plush queen-sized bed as even the sultan has the humility to forgo what a king requires.

## About us

As this will be a new house, adjacent to our current one, you should be introduced to the present cast:

### Larthur
I'm in my mid twenties, a pretty chill dude, and I moved to SF about a year ago. I like the outdoors, playing music, sports, and, most of all, I like making things. I work a pretty regular schedule, about 9-5 M-F and when I'm at home I usually just relax and work on my little projects. Personally, I'm not super into partying at my house, but, ironically, I really enjoy throwing really good house parties. I guess I just want there to be good energy with the occasional fiesta experience.

### Christy
Christy wants to meet you.

Hi, I'm from West Virginia but I've lived in Sydney Australia before, mate! Give me a Foster's and we'll chill outback style.

### Boden

Reno, full time agent of Goldman Sachs, however secretly undercover to bring down the system. Builds drones while riding motorcycles, and has been occasionally known to breath fire. Also likes to chill.

### SAM

Sam is super cool and from Austin and builds tiny houses and you will like him trust me.

### Hoopie

That is her real name.

### birds
There're some birds living in the backyard. You have to be cool with them.

## About you

Be yourself! It can be so uninviting when you read these ads and people are all like "You need to be in this field and have this gender and these interests and hang out all the time or keep to yourself and you can't use this room etc..." No. I hate that. What I care about is that you're open minded and that's about it. I'm not trying to create the master race here. I'd much rather just let individual people's own personalities mix, and if an issue comes up, then we settle it. So part of being open minded is being communicative too. Basically, I don't want to control the experience. Instead, I want to be like a gardner: let the experience grow, but keep an eye for any weeds (drama queens, emotional vampires, close-mindedness, etc...)

Other than that, just be you :)

### Things you have to be ok with
* There's a piano in the house.
* Talking

## What's next?

We're going to have an open house when it gets closer to the deadline. It would be cool if you could write us an email telling us whatever you think is important so we have a chance to read up on you before you come, but you can also just come.

## FAQ
Do you allow couples:
- It's a possibility. We'd love to provide people with a place where they can share their love, but there are complications associated with this. Let's discuss further.

Can I bring my pet:
- Yes! <3<3<3
