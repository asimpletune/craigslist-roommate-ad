We are:
* AOK

You are:
* Yourself (hopefully)

## The place:
The Presidio is a former military base/mission turned national park. Located at the at the foot of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, the Presidio is one of the few places you can live in the city, where it doesn't feel like you're living in the city. Imagine beverly hills country club meets redwood tree forests, all bordered by rocky cliffs crumbling into sandy beaches by the ocean.

### Blueprint
The house has 3 floors, a basement, and a garage. See ascii art image for more details on floorplan.

### Second floor Bathroom

There are 4 bathrooms in the house. We all share, and there has never been a shortage of bathrooms.

### Common areas of note
The house has a lot of space and really beautiful commons. You have to see it to fully appreciate it but here's a preview.

#### Kitchen

The kitchen's pretty cool. We have a lot of counter and cabinet space. We have TWO fridges!!! (Can you believe it?) If you're into coffee then you can make some here. Also, you can make food. We use reusable lint-free towels instead of paper towels which is cool and it makes cleaning really easy.

Some of us cook every day, some of us not at all.

#### Living/Music room

This room used to be the "mid-centch" room. Now it's a little of that but also a creative music space. You can be a mid-centchual...

But seriously, there's a lot of beauty in the commons space and people are always lounging about.

#### Dining room

It's like the living room but without as nice furniture. It also has table with chairs... It has become more mid-centch than what used to be the mid-centch room. It is a pleasing space that feels good to resipirate in.

#### Back Porch

This is a major chill zone. We have two of these mid-centch sofas and we chill hard here. The weather's almost always nice so this is a great place to chill.

#### Cinema

We have an amazing movie theater. You wouldn't believe it...

#### Ping-pong

We no-longer play everyday. But if you wanted to revive this that's ok. Now I think other things are in vogue.

### Description of Rooms:

All of rooms in the house are equally nice, seriously. The only real difference is price, for which you get space in exchange. Here's some extra info for your perusal. There are no pictures, but as you can imagine there are walls, windows and hardwood floor, with the exception of one room that has carpet. They look like the rest of the house except smaller...

#### The Intern's Quarters (S sized)

Ah yes, in the fast-paced, ever-changing landscape of this modern error, what better place to get a start of this brave new world than in the intern's quarters? Spartan this room may be, with dimensions at around 8'x 15', nonetheless it is but a key to the kingdom of heaven that awaits in one's mind.

#### The Squire's Boudoir (M sized)

Many squires' songs have been written for heroes of old in this inspirational space. Due to its excellent location, the squire's boudoir arguable receives the most light in the house. It also has an excellent closet, capable of holding all of your master's armor with room left still for a large trunk of ointments and other embrocations.

#### The Despot's Spire (M sized)

Way up amongst the highest tower of our castle, lies the DESPOT'S SPIRE!!! Here, situated on the 3rd floor of the house, you may contrive your ploys and plots, as you so love to do! Rest assured that you will have ample head space to weigh the pros and cons of your political calculus, as the Despot's Spire is more secluded than the other rooms.

#### The Viceroy's Chamber (L sized)

In this room, the viceroy can ponder the world, as you stroke your beard/pony tail. The is a large room available and you will find much wisdom to be found, as you gaze out your bay facing window from within this stately corner room. Or if you tire of the sea, you can train your eyes on our sideyard, which is next to a highway (no, we don't mind. It's not that bad and it keeps the beasts at bay).

#### The Sultan's Suite (XL sized) THIS ROOM IS VACANT!!!

In this room, masters of their domain may bask in the glow of peace and comfort of the large open space and numerous windows. This allows for effortless concentration for someone who needs to ponder the sublime and infinite. This furnished room has an office, dedicated seating/living area for entertaining your subjects, and a plush queen-sized bed as even the sultan has the humility to forgo what a king requires.

## About us

This is a description of the people who currently live here.

### Larthur

I am a relaxed person who likes to spend their time on creative endeavors like working on little projects.

### Nikita

Nikita has a fanatical following stemming from his one-time involvement in the production of Romeo & Juliet, where he starred a Romeo. There are no videos on YouTube interviewing him about how he learned how to sword fight to choreograph the scenes.

### Charlotte

Charlotte rules and everyone else drools. She also has a dog named Toast, who does not drool - actually. She is super fun and playful, but also serious and good at cleaning. Carbon based, homeostasis a must.

### Ryan

Ryan is zen. Feel his peace. Now let it get. Breath Ryan in, breath Ryan out. 

### birds
There're some birds living in the backyard. You have to be cool with them.

## About you

Be yourself! It can be so uninviting when you read these ads and people are all like "You need to be in this field and have this gender and these interests and hang out all the time or keep to yourself and you can't use this room etc..." No. I hate that. What I care about is that you're open minded and that's about it. I'm not trying to create the master race here. I'd much rather just let individual people's own personalities mix, and if an issue comes up, then we settle it. So part of being open minded is being communicative too. Basically, I don't want to control the experience. Instead, I want to be like a gardener: let the experience grow, but keep an eye for any weeds (drama queens, emotional vampires, close-mindedness, etc...)

Other than that, just be you :)

### Things you have to be ok with
* There's a piano in the house.
* Talking

## What's next?

We're going to have an open house when it gets closer to the deadline. It would be cool if you could write us an email telling us whatever you think is important so we have a chance to read up on you before you come, but you can also just come.

## FAQ
Do you allow couples:
- Yes!

Can I bring my pet:
- Maybe, but probably not. Let's see your pet first but set your expectations!

Parking/Commuting options:
- We have tons of paid parking! There's a monthly pass for ~$30/mo, or you can risk it and get a ticket maybe once a year?
- There is also a neighborhood shuttle that goes directly downtown in about 20 min. This is good if you work downtown.
- Generally speaking, this is NOT the middle of downtown San Francisco. In fact, it is never downtown San Francisco. So, if being super close to everything is important to you then you will not like living here. To be perfectly honest, this is the kind of place for people who having a happy home is the most important thing to them. Also, this place is good for people who value having a car and go on lots of weekend trips to Tahoe or something like that. Presidio rules!!!
