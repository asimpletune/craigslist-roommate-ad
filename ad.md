# Officer's house in the Presidio with "pretty" cool people
Hey you, glad you found this ad. My name is Larthur and I live at the house.

It's that time of year where beaver tails are thumping, birds be chirping, and people come and go. Sadly, our friends are moving to greener pastures, but what luck you have! This is a really lovely place, and we're all really happy, so we hope you like it as much as we do.

**tl;dr**
All the rooms are super nice, the house is amazing, and we're "ok".
We have:
* 2 rooms available as early as August 1st
  * Large sized room $1610, bay view
  * Medium sized room $1240, forest view
* One room available September 1st.
  * Small sized room $900, forrest view (no closet)

We are:
* AOK

You are:
* Yourself (hopefully)

Open house:
* this saturday (07/25/2015)
* Maybe send an email too before you come if you have time

Also, this place will go very quickly so please keep that in mind.

## The place:
The Presidio is a former military base/mission turned national park. Located at the at the foot of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, the Presidio is one of the few places you can live in the city, where it doesn't feel like you're living in the city.

### Blueprint
The house has 3 floors, a basement, and a garage:

### Second floor Bathroom

There are 4 bathrooms in the house. This is one of them. No, you don't have to use this. I just wanted to show it to you. The others are equally nice. We all share, and there has never been a shortage of bathrooms.

### Common areas of note
The house has a lot of space and really beautiful commons. You have to see it to fully appreciate it but here's a preview.

#### Kitchen

The kitchen's pretty cool. We have a lot of counter and cabinet space. Fridge space could be improved, but we have plans to get a second fridge. If you're into coffee, we have a pretty nice machine. Also, we use reusable lint-free towels instead of paper towels which is cool and it makes cleaning really easy.

Some of us cook every day, some of us not at all.

#### Living room

This room is the "mid-centch" room. You better be a mid-centchual...

But seriously, there's a lot of beauty in the commons space and people are always lounging about.

#### Dining room

It's like the living room but without as nice furniture. It also has table with chairs...

#### Back Porch

This is a major chill zone. We have two of these mid-centch sofas and we chill hard here. The weather's almost always nice so this is a great place to chill.

### Rooms available

All of rooms in the house are equally nice, seriously. The only real difference is price, for which you get space in exchange. Here's some extra info for your perusal. There are no pictures, but as you can imagine there are walls, windows and hardwood floor. They look like the rest of the house except smaller...

#### The Viceroy's Chamber

In this room, the viceroy can ponder the world, as you stroke your beard/pony tail. The is the largest room available and you will find much wisdom to be found, as you gaze out your bay facing window from within this stately corner room. Or if you tire of the sea, you can train your eyes on our sideyard, which is next to a highway (no, we don't mind. It's not that bad and it keeps the beasts at bay).

There's plenty of closet space as well for your fine silks and ray bans.

#### The Squire's Boudoir

Many squires' songs have been written for heroes of old in this inspirational space. Due to its excellent location, the squire's boudoir arguable receives the most light in the house. It also has an excellent closet, capable of holding all of your master's armor with room left still for a large trunk of ointments and other embrocations.

#### The Intern's Quarters

Ah yes, in the fast-paced, ever-changing landscape of this modern error, what better place to get a start of this brave new world than in the intern's quarters?

## About us

### Larthur
I'm in my mid twenties, a pretty chill dude, and I moved to SF about a year ago. I like the outdoors, playing music, sports, and, most of all, I like making things. I work a pretty regular schedule, about 9-5 M-F and when I'm at home I usually just relax and work on my little projects. Personally, I'm not super into partying at my house, but, ironically, I really enjoy throwing really good house parties. I guess I just want there to be good energy with the occasional fiesta experience.

### Sydney
What's up party people.

I've been living in bigger places with lots of people for a while now. I believe that guidelines in the style of "we are allowed to hang out this much but also must maintain this level of distance" or "you are only allowed to be home or to go out this often," though well-intentioned, can actually be harmful. I like my relationships with the people in my house to be simple in their lack of definition. We can easily create a caring community of independent individuals by having everyone do their own thing to whatever extreme that means for each person, drawing the line somewhere around "don't be a dick." I like it when my housemates and I can laugh together and not take everything (including ourselves) too seriously.

About me as a human bean: if I were a bean, I would probably be the abandoned love child of a kidney bean and cannellini bean. I like music a lot and pay close attention to what rappers are up to via social media. I cook and bake frequently so there are goodies around (usually free of common allergens). I'm pretty into the fact that I live in a forest next to a beach. I work a few days a week at a restaurant. I have other interests too but will not list them here.

### birds
There're some birds living in the backyard. You have to be cool with them.

## About you

Be yourself! It can be so uninviting when you read these ads and people are all like "You need to be in this field and have this gender and these interests and hang out all the time or keep to yourself and you can't use this room etc..." No. I hate that. What I care about is that you're open minded and that's about it. I'm not trying to create the master race here. I'd much rather just let individual people's own personalities mix, and if an issue comes up, then we settle it. So part of being open minded is being communicative too. Basically, I don't want to control the experience. Instead, I want to be like a gardner: let the experience grow, but keep an eye for any weeds (drama queens, emotional vampires, close-mindedness, etc...)

Other than that, just be you :)

### Things you have to be ok with
* There's a piano in the house.
* Talking

## What's next?

We're going to have an open house this Saturday July 25th, 2015. It would be cool if you could write us an email telling us whatever you think is important so we have a chance to read up on you before you come, but you can also just come.

## FAQ
Do you allow couples:
- Probably not, but maybe... best to try any way but don't get your hopes up.

Can I bring my pet:
- Also, probably not, sorry, however also maybe... maybe bring your pet to the open house.
